-- Version 2.0-release1 --

Current state has around 7 API calls that are functioning for testing against client servers.

You do not need to Whitelist the IP for this to work as long as you have the API Access key that is to be added in your configuration.php file.

For assistance on how to do this, please see the docs pages:

http://docs.whmcs.com/API:Access_Keys

Simply insert your WHMCS user, followed by the Password for that user, the API Key from the config file and the URL to your /includes/api.php file (eg. http|s://domain.com/pathtowhmcsroot/includes/api.php

From the drop down select your call you wish to test.

**Depending on the call you choose, additionfields will load on the page in which you will place the information to make the call**

Select you response type (eg. JSON or XML) and then submit your query.

The results will be displayed at the bottom of the page in the debug output box.

Any questions, you can email me chance@whmcs.com
